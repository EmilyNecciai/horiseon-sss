## User Story

As a marketing agency, I want a codebase that follows accessibility standards so that our own site is optimized for search engines.

> My Notes: 
> We were told to focus on HTML and CSS, especially organization, cleanliness, and efficiency of workflow. 

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards: 

1. WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements

2. WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

3. WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes

4. WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order

5. WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## Technical Acceptance Criteria
> To become Issues for task tracking. 

Satisfies all of the preceding acceptance criteria plus the following code improvements:

1. Application's links all function correctly.
2. Application's CSS selectors and properties are consolidated and organized to follow semantic structure.
3. Application's CSS file is properly commented.
4. Application deployed at live URL.
5. Application loads with no errors.
6. Application GitHub URL submitted.
7. GitHub repository that contains application code.
8. Application resembles (at least 90%) screenshots provided in challenge instructions.
9. Repository has a unique name.
10. Repository follows best practices for file structure and naming conventions.
11. Repository follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.
12. Repository contains multiple descriptive commit messages.
13. Repository contains quality README file with description, screenshot, and link to deployed application.


## The Plan

1. Put Tasks listed below in as issues. 
2. Complete Tasks. 
3. One push per issue, naming with Issue # in git commit. 
4. Link Github Page and Repo to Challenge location in GW Bootcampspot.

### Task 1: Place Semantic HTML Elements

1. Review the current code. 
2. Break up the mock up into appropriate pieces. Do the same in the code with extra spacing. 
3. Replace HTML elements with semantic ones, where relevant. 
> Ensure you're keeping track of the open and closing tags. 


### Task 2: Revise HTML into Logical Structure

1. Review the current code. 
2. Ensure divs and semantic elements are contained properly within one another. (Base off of Step 2 in Task 1.)

### Task 3: Image Elements have `alt` Attributes
1. Add new or clean up existing attributes. 

> Notes: Don't use "Image of..." or things like that. Be informational for image readers. 

### Task 4: Heading Attributes in Sequential Order

### Task 5: Title Element should be both Concise and Descriptive

### General Debugging as a Last Step
